Here is a list of Good technology learning resources..

* [Code School][code-school] - Good resource to [learn AngularJS][code-school-angular] and other technologies.

* [Github][git-learn] - This teaches the basics, there is also a link for the advanced topics, I use Git regularly at work and home and I still find it useful to brush up few commands that I tend to forget.

* [Project Euler][project-euler] - Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve.
* http://codepen.io/ Frontend development online IDE.
