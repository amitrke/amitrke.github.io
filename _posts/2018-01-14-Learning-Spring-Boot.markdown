Spring boot can help create a Spring web application or a REST web service very quickly without much configuration.

Navigate to the Spring Initializr website http://start.spring.io/
Generate a Gradle with Java and Spring Boot 2.0.0
Give a Group and Artifact name
Select dependencies
    Reactive Web, Reactive MongoDB, Theamyleaf, Lombok
Generate project
A zip file will be downloaded, it has the boilerplate code to get started, the good thing is that there is not much generated code.
